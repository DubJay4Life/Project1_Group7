In regards to IMDB ratings and runtime, there are some factors that need to considered.  In this Analysis, the movies that have the shorter runtime of under 150 minutes have a IMDB movie rating.  Whereas, the movies that have the longer runtime of 150 minutes and beyond have resulted in lower IMDB movie ratings.  Even though this Analysis is based off of over 700 movies, there will be a select few that will stand out as having a high runtime and a high IMDB movie rating and there are a select few with a low runtime and a low IMBD movie rating.  For example, The Shawshank Redemption has the highest IMDB rating of all movies with a 9.3 with a runtime of 142 minutes.  Also Searching has the lowest IMDB rating of 7.6 with a runtime of 102 minutes.  However, there are other variables to recognize as well regarding runtime and IMDB rating.  Gone with the Wind has the highest runtime of all movies in this dataset of 238 minutes, which means your day would have to be pretty free to watch this movie, but has a IMDB rating of 8.1.  La planete sauvage has the lowest runtime of all movies of 72 minutes with a IMBD score of 7.8.  Not to get off topic, but The Shawshank Redemption was directed by Frank Darabont who has been nominated for 30 awards and won 15 with notable movies such as The Green Mile, King Kong and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 just to name a few.  Whereas La planete sauvage was directed by Rene Laloux who is a French animator and film director who was nominated for three awards and won three awards for older films.  The demographic with these two directors is night and day which could've played a part in their individual recognitions.  Overall, the difference in ratings between movies with short and long movies are statistically significant with the exception of a handful based on different scenarios and variables.
